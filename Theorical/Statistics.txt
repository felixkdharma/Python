`````````````` Descriptive Statics ``````````````
- describes the characteristics of a data set.
- Thre basic categories of measures are measure of central tendency, measures of variability and frequency
distributin
- measure of central tendency (mean = average, median = middle value, mode = the most occurance data)
- measure of variability describe the dispersion of the data set (variance, standar deviation)
- measure of frequency distribution describe the occurrence of data within the data set (count)

`````````````` Inferential Statistics ``````````````
- a set of method that is used to draw a conclusion about the characteristics of
population based on the sample of the data.
- used to find the population parameter when you have no initial number to start with

`````````````` Types of data ``````````````

- Categorical data: a data where the values are characteristics (Gender: F, M or Location: IDN, JPN)
- Numerical data: a data where the values are numerical (Age: 30,21 or Salary: 100, 200)

- Qualitative: nominal data and ordinal data (also known as categorical data)
- Quantitave: discrete data and continuous data (also known as numerical data)

``````````` Qualitative Data ``````````````

-- Nominal data label the variables without providing the numerical value
-- also called nominal scale where it cannot be ordered and measured
-- the data grouped into categories

-- Ordinal Data the data can be ordered
-- the information may be expressed with table in which each row in the table
shows the distinct category.

``````````````````````````````````````````

``````````` Qualitative Data ``````````````
-- Discrete data can take only discrete values.
-- count data that have non decimal values exp (age, number of worker)

-- Continous data can be calcualted and have infinite number of probable values
-- can be selected within a given specific range exp (height, width)

```````````````````````````````````````````

``````````` Sampling Method ``````````````
-- Population is a whole data that exists
-- Sample is a few some data (not all data collected) from population and will be used for analytical
sample is important because, can make information faster, easily analyse the data.

-- Probability Sampling Every member of population has an equal chance of beng selected 

exp: simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, cluster sampling, systematic sampling
-- Non Probability Sampling samples are selected on the basis of judgement or the conveniece of accessing data
exp: conveniece sampling, Purposive sampling, Voluntary Response sampling, Snowball sampling

(PROBABILITY SAMPLING)
-- Random Sampling
randomly choose a member of population
every member and set of member has an equal Probability

-- Systematic Sampling
put a member of the population in some order and starting point is choose as 
random the ever 'nth' member is selected as a sample.

-- Stratified Sampling
creating a sample of data based on the distribution of data (1000 records have 600 male and 400 female)
first divide the population into group
then from each group we select members randmoly

-- Cluster Random Sampling 
divide the population into groups
randomly select the group from all the groups
step: 
1. get a population 
2. divide a population into cluster
3. randomly using the cluster's sample

(NON PROBABILITY SAMPLING)
-- Convenience sampling
Include the responds/members who are easy to reach the researcher.

-- Purposive sampling
select a sample based on the purpose of the researcher
researcher select the sample by using their expertise and knowledge

-- Voluntary Response Sampling
based on the ease of access data
members volunteer themselves insted of researcher selecting the participants and directly contact themselves

-- Snowball sampling
recruit the participants via research participants for test or study
used where it's hard to find the potential population for research 

-- Term of Sampling
std: its a meassure of how spread numbers are

--- Descriptive Analytics ---
1. Measures of Central Tendency
- Measures the center of data set.
- Give us about the concentration of the value in central part of distribution
ex (mean/average, median, mode)
-- Mean --
1. it compute the sum of all observation divided total of data set.
why do we use mean ?
- to handle the missing values (basic handling missing values)
formula: sigma X / n

-- Median --
2. middle number
- number of observations (n) is odd 
- the median is the middle value which is at position (3rd data and 3rd data)
- the data set it should be sorted
formula: (n  + 1)/n

-- Mode -- 
3. Mode
- the most frequency number of observations in the dataset.

--- Measures of Dispresion ---
that how the data is dispresed from the measure of central tendency.
1. Range difference max and min value (formula max - min)
2. variance 
- indicates how the data is dispread around the mean.
- measure of the dispresion of the data set.
- if the value of variance is lower to mean then it's a low variance.
- if there is significant difference between value and mean than its high variance.
formula (sigma (x-mu)^2 / n )
3. IQR (Inter-Quality Range) Q3-Q1
- measure the middle 50% of the data.
- indicates how the data is dispread around the mean.
- helpful to detech the outliers from the data set.
4. Standar Deviation the square root of variance
- most important and frequently method in meassures of dispression
- indicate how far away the datapoints in dispressed from the dataset.
5. Mean deviation 
- average of range data from mean.
formula (|x-mu|/n)
