`````````````` Descriptive Statics ``````````````
- describes the characteristics of a data set.
- Thre basic categories of measures are measure of central tendency, measures of variability and frequency
distributin
- measure of central tendency (mean = average, median = middle value, mode = the most occurance data)
- measure of variability describe the dispersion of the data set (variance, standar deviation)
- measure of frequency distribution describe the occurrence of data within the data set (count)

`````````````` Inferential Statistics ``````````````
- a set of method that is used to draw a conclusion about the characteristics of
population based on the sample of the data.
- used to find the population parameter when you have no initial number to start with

`````````````` Types of data ``````````````

- Categorical data: a data where the values are characteristics (Gender: F, M or Location: IDN, JPN)
- Numerical data: a data where the values are numerical (Age: 30,21 or Salary: 100, 200)

- Qualitative: nominal data and ordinal data (also known as categorical data)
- Quantitave: discrete data and continuous data (also known as numerical data)

``````````` Qualitative Data ``````````````

-- Nominal data label the variables without providing the numerical value
-- also called nominal scale where it cannot be ordered and measured
-- the data grouped into categories

-- Ordinal Data the data can be ordered
-- the information may be expressed with table in which each row in the table
shows the distinct category.

``````````` Qualitative Data ``````````````
-- Discrete data can take only discrete values.
-- count data that have non decimal values exp (age, number of worker)

-- Continous data can be calcualted and have infinite number of probable values
-- can be selected within a given specific range exp (height, width)
